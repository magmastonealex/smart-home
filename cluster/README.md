Dumping ground for now. Contains Ansible scripts used to bootstrap a micro-PC cluster with Nomad, Consul, Vault, Gluster, and BGP, providing HA services for my homelab.

TODOs:
- Configure Traefik for HTTPS
- Configure anycast BGP peering with cloud VPS
- get Vault up and running for secrets storage
