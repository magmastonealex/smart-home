- [X] Bring up a basic firmware to test functionality of the EVL-4 (serial, LEDs)
- [X] Add support for the Ethernet PHY/MAC
- [X] Clean up MAC/PHY driver
- [X] Start implementing IP stack, since I just need some basic UDP bits.....
- [X] CoAP server/client support.
- [ ] ~TFTP OTA upgrades - punting on this for now. Might get back to it later.~
- [X] IN PROGRESS - CoAP pubsub server & client implementation.
- [X] Bring in the UNO-8 library developed as part of the test program
- [X] Implement support for the RTC peripheral
