This is a (very, very bad) ESP8266 application to report the state of an UNO-8 expander board over MQTT.

It probably shouldn't be used for anything. Or if you do, you'll want to do some serious refactoring (it's really bad!)
I'm using it to sanity check my alarm installation while I bring up the EVL-4 board on custom firmware. It's good enough to add sensors to home assistant and confirm they work. But you shouldn't use it!
