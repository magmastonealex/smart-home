- EVL-4 uses xmega64d4. Lock bits are set, but JTAG is enabled - can re-program.
- Other board uses attiny441.
- Communication is over i2c.
- Seems like return values are 8 bytes of ANALOG data. The data is then interpreted by the mainboard.
- 2nd board lives at 0x20.
- 24LC512 eeprom on evl-4 at 0x50.
- Seems to poll 0x00 -> module info
- 0x10 -> return analog data
- 0x30 - buzzer?
- 0x31 - pgm output?

Programming header pinout (from top)
- gnd
- N/C
- VCC
- reset/PDI clock
- PDI data


these are unknown:
write to 0x20 ack data: 0x20 0x00 
write to 0x20 ack data: 0x28 0x00 
write to 0x20 ack data: 0x21 0x00 
write to 0x20 ack data: 0x29 0x00
but repetitive.

- asix ax88796blf is Ethernet PHY

- avr-uip stack
- https://github.com/atx/umqtt/blob/master/umqtt/umqtt.c
- https://github.com/atx/avr-mqtt-board/blob/master/src/main.c - tying stuff together
- avrlib (downloaded in this dir) has a driver which might be a good starting point.

- Major porting efforts:
	- Pin mappings for ATXMega
        - Clock configuration
        - See if we can get a hex file built which incorporates everything...
- Can wire sensors to UNO-8 board connected to ESP8266 for now. This is likely "good enough" until either support helps out with TPI, or custom firmware can be developed.

- fuse1: 0x07 0000 0111
  - wdt settings
- fuse2: 0xBF 1011 1111
  - enter bootloader on reset
  - BOD disabled
- fuse4: 0xF1 1111 0001
  - reset enabled
  - startup time - 60 cycles.
  - WDLock programmd - watchdog always enabled, config not changeable.
- fuse5: ???
- LOCK: 0x3C  0011 1100
  - Bootloader: RWLOCK - nothing can 
  - BLBA: NOLOCK (SPM/ELPM allowed on app section)
  - Apptable: NOLOCK
  - LB: RWLOCK - no reading of flash/eeprom :(

i2c goes to pe1 and pe0

USARTD0 goes to debug header - PD3 TX, PD2 RX.
Debug header H6, from left to right:
- 12V TX
- GND
- GND
- 12V RX
- +12V.

PD4 - NC
PD5 - WP on EEPROM
PD6 - none
PD7 - none
PE0/PE1-i2c
PE2 - I/O?
PE3 - I/O?
PR1 - crystal-disc
PR0 - crystal-disc

RST pads go to PD4

LEDs are active high

KEYB - PD1
OPER - PD0
NET - PB3
ONLINE - PB2
LINK - Driven off of ASIX LK/ACT

Crystal used for ASIX - chip seems to be off internal oscillator.

ASIX:

SA0 -PA0
SA1 - PA1
SA2 -PA2
SA3 -PA3
SA4 -PA4
SA5 - Disconnected (pulled low internal?)

PA5 - WRn
PA6 - RDn
PA7 - CSn

USARTD0 -> PD3 TX -> transistor - pin 3 of H6 (count from white side
USARTD0 -> PD2 RX -> transistor (MMBT3904L) - pin 2 of H6 i

- Being used in 8 bit data mode (yay!)
- PC is used for data bus.

- IOIS16 not asserted
- PME - unused
- AEN - tied low?
- IRQ - PB1
- RSTn - PB0 - 4.7k to gnd. Held in reset!

PB0 - 4.7K -> gnd!? 


Power via RT8284N
