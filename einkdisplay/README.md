This is an e-ink calendar for a Waveshare 7.5inch e-ink panel, driven by an ESP8266.

Currently I have a proof-of-concept golang server which serves bitmap images to the ESP, which pulls and renders the image on an interval.

More hardware details & improved software coming sometime Soon. The server code is _really_ rough and intended to be just good enough to prove my UI designs out before a from-scratch rewrite.
